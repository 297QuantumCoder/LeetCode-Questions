To understand the approach for solving the problem of trapping rainwater given an elevation map, let's break down the thought process and the solution step-by-step.

### Understanding the Problem

The problem involves an array of non-negative integers representing the height of bars in an elevation map, where each bar has a width of 1 unit. When it rains, water collects in the valleys between these bars. Our task is to calculate the total amount of trapped water.

### Key Insight

The amount of water trapped above each bar depends on the height of the tallest bars to the left and right of that bar. Specifically, the water level above a bar is determined by the shorter of the two tallest bars (one on the left and one on the right). The difference between this water level and the height of the bar gives the amount of water that can be trapped above that bar.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Precompute Maximum Heights**:
   - For each bar, we need to know the maximum height of the bars to its left and the maximum height of the bars to its right.
   - We can achieve this by precomputing two arrays:
     - `leftMax[i]`: the maximum height from the start up to the `i`th bar.
     - `rightMax[i]`: the maximum height from the `i`th bar to the end.

2. **Calculate Trapped Water**:
   - For each bar, determine the potential water level above it using the precomputed arrays.
   - The water level above the `i`th bar is the minimum of `leftMax[i]` and `rightMax[i]`, because water can't be higher than the shorter of the tallest bars on either side.
   - The actual water trapped above the bar is the difference between this water level and the height of the bar itself.
   - Sum up the trapped water for all bars to get the total amount of trapped water.

### Thinking Through the Solution

1. **Initialization**:
   - Recognize that for each bar, the amount of water trapped depends on the heights of the surrounding bars.
   - Decide to use additional space (two arrays) to store the maximum heights to the left and right of each bar, which allows us to compute the trapped water in linear time.

2. **Filling `leftMax` and `rightMax` Arrays**:
   - For `leftMax`, iterate from left to right. At each position, store the maximum height encountered so far.
   - For `rightMax`, iterate from right to left. At each position, store the maximum height encountered so far.

3. **Computing Trapped Water**:
   - For each bar, use the precomputed `leftMax` and `rightMax` to determine the water level above the bar.
   - Calculate the trapped water at each position and sum it up.

### C++ Code

Here's the implementation of the explained approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int trap(std::vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Create and fill leftMax array
        std::vector<int> leftMax(n);
        leftMax[0] = height[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            leftMax[i] = std::max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i]);
        }

        // Create and fill rightMax array
        std::vector<int> rightMax(n);
        rightMax[n - 1] = height[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            rightMax[i] = std::max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i]);
        }

        // Calculate the trapped water
        int waterTrapped = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            waterTrapped += std::max(std::min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i], 0);
        }

        return waterTrapped;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the height array is empty or too small to trap any water, return 0 immediately.

2. **Precompute Maximum Heights**:
   - **Left to Right Pass**: Fill the `leftMax` array where each position `i` contains the maximum height from the start up to that position.
   - **Right to Left Pass**: Fill the `rightMax` array where each position `i` contains the maximum height from that position to the end.

3. **Calculate Trapped Water**:
   - Iterate over each bar. For each bar, calculate the water level as the minimum of `leftMax[i]` and `rightMax[i]`.
   - The trapped water at each bar is the difference between this water level and the height of the bar itself.
   - Accumulate the trapped water for the final result.

By using this systematic approach, we efficiently compute the total trapped water with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and space complexity of \(O(n)\).

### Explanation

The problem requires us to place `m` balls into `n` baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximized. This can be solved using a binary search approach combined with a greedy algorithm.

1. **Sort the Positions**: First, we need to sort the array of positions. This helps in easily calculating the magnetic force in a sequential manner.

2. **Binary Search**: We will use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum magnetic force.
   - The lower bound (`low`) of our search is 1, which is the smallest possible distance.
   - The upper bound (`high`) is the difference between the maximum and minimum positions in the sorted array, which is the largest possible distance.

3. **Greedy Check**: For each candidate minimum force (midpoint in our binary search), we check if it's possible to place all `m` balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least this candidate force.
   - Start by placing the first ball in the first basket.
   - Place each subsequent ball in the next basket that is at least `mid` distance away from the last placed ball.
   - If we can place all `m` balls this way, then it's possible for this candidate force; otherwise, it is not.

4. **Adjust Search Range**: Based on whether the current candidate force is possible, adjust the binary search range:
   - If possible, move the lower bound up to try for a larger minimum force.
   - If not possible, move the upper bound down to try for a smaller minimum force.

### C++ Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool canPlaceBalls(vector<int>& position, int m, int minDist) {
    int count = 1; // Place the first ball in the first basket
    int lastPosition = position[0]; // Track the position of the last placed ball

    for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); ++i) {
        if (position[i] - lastPosition >= minDist) {
            count++;
            lastPosition = position[i];
            if (count == m) {
                return true; // All balls have been placed successfully
            }
        }
    }

    return false; // Not all balls could be placed with the given minDist
}

int maxMinForce(vector<int>& position, int m) {
    sort(position.begin(), position.end()); // Sort the positions
    
    int low = 1; // Minimum possible distance
    int high = position.back() - position.front(); // Maximum possible distance
    int result = 0;
    
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        
        if (canPlaceBalls(position, m, mid)) {
            result = mid; // mid is a valid answer, try for a larger minimum force
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1; // mid is not valid, try for a smaller minimum force
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> position1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7};
    int m1 = 3;
    cout << "Example 1 Output: " << maxMinForce(position1, m1) << endl;

    vector<int> position2 = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1000000000};
    int m2 = 2;
    cout << "Example 2 Output: " << maxMinForce(position2, m2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **`canPlaceBalls` Function**:
   - This function checks if we can place all `m` balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least `minDist`.
   - It places the first ball in the first position and then iterates through the positions, placing each subsequent ball in the next valid position (i.e., at least `minDist` away from the last placed ball).

2. **`maxMinForce` Function**:
   - This function implements the binary search over the possible minimum distances.
   - It sorts the positions, sets the initial search range, and iteratively adjusts the range based on whether the current candidate distance is valid.

3. **`main` Function**:
   - This function tests the solution with the provided examples and prints the results.
